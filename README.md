# A C++ spatially explicit multispecies model for vegetal communities and invasions

This is an stochastic cellular automata (CA) model with the following features

* Habitat patches: you can define patches where species can't growth or colonize

* Species specific parameters: each species has it's own set of parameters

* Random or fixed initial conditions

* Ripley's K calculation, velocity of invasion, and 2D spectral analysis, on the run. 

* Configuration of multiple simulations with different parameters combinations
